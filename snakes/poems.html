    <h3>Snakes</h3>

We, as a society,
have made some big mistakes.
One of which (a smallish one)
is hoe we look at snakes.
Most people think they're scary,
that they're evil,
that they're cruel.
it's not truth!
They are gorgeous things.
They're honestly, so coll.
They're quiet, calm and docile.
They move with with ease and grace.
They're beautiful,
Their skin and eyes,
that little derpy face.
They're cute. it's fact.
you disagree?
you're wrong for goodness sake!
and if you say that one more time,
I'll feed to my snake.
